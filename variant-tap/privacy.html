  <h1>Variant Tap Privacy Policy</h1>
  
  <p>
    Last updated December 22, 2019.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy governs your use of the software application Variant Tap (the "Application") for mobile devices that was created by Ryan Dancy. The Application is a mobile game.
  </p>
  
  <h2>What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?</h2>
  
  <h3>User-Provided Information</h3>
  
  <p>
    We do not ask you to provide us with any information. If you contact us for support, we may collect any information you choose to provide us.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Automatically Collected Information</h3>
  
  <p>
    The Application may collect certain information automatically, including, but not limited to, your mobile device's unique, resettable advertising ID.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In jurisdictions in which consent is required for the collection of personal information, information is collected only after you have consented to its collection.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The Application explicitly DOES NOT collect sensitive personal information such as your email address, physical address, legal name, location, contacts, or phone number.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Does the Application collect precise real-time location information of the device?</h2>
  
  <p>
    The Application does not collect precise information about the location of your mobile device.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by the Application?</h2>
  
  <p>
    Yes. We will share your information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We may disclose user-provided and automatically collected information:
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process;
      </li>
      <li>
        when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request;
      </li>
      <li>
        to any successor or purchaser if a future corporation owning the Application is involved in a merger, acquisition, liquidation, dissolution, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, or if the Application is sold;
      </li>
      <li>
        and to advertisers and third party advertising networks and analytics companies as described below.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  
  <h2>Automatic Data Collection and Advertising</h2>
  
  <p>
    We may work with analytics companies to help us understand how the Application is being used. We work with Google's AdMob advertising network which needs to know how you interact with advertising provided in the Application which helps us keep the Application free. Advertisers and advertising networks use some of the information collected by this Application and in other Web sites and applications, including your device's unique advertising ID. The information collected may be linked to your device, but is never linked to your identity.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You may learn more about how your data is used by Google's advertising networks <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads">here</a>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you would like to opt-out from third-party use of this type of information to serve targeted advertising, please visit the section entitled "What are my opt-out rights?" below.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you are in a jurisdiction in which consent must be obtained before data is collected, advertisers and advertising networks will not serve targeted ads within the Application until explicit opt-in consent is received.
  </p>
  
  <h2>What are my opt-out rights?</h2>
  
  <p>There are multiple opt-out options for users of the Application:</p>
  
  <p>
    <h4>Opt-out of all information collection by uninstalling the Application:</h4> you can stop all collection of information by the Application easily by uninstalling the Application. You may use standard uninstall processes as may be available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <h4>Opt-out from the use of information to serve targeted advertising by advertisers and/or third-party advertising networks:</h4> you may at any time opt-out from targeted advertising by visiting <a href="https://adssettings.google.com">Google's ad personalization settings</a>. If you are located in a jurisdiction in which consent must be obtained for targeted advertising, you may change your consent in the About screen in the Application. If you have not consented to receive personalized advertising, the advertisements you see will be non-personalized and your information will not be used to serve them.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Data Retention Policy, Managing Your Information</h2>
  
  <p>
    We will retain any user-provided data for as long as you use the Application and for a reasonable time thereafter. We will retain automatically collected information for up to 48 months and thereafter may store it in aggregate. If you would like us to delete any user-provided data you have provided, please contact us at copperium.studios@gmail.com. We will respond in a reasonable time.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    To request the deletion of data held by third parties, please contact those third parties directly:
    
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy#infodelete">Google AdMob</a></li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  
  <h2>Children</h2>
  
  <p>
    We do not use the Application to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13 (or 16 in the European Union). If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with information without their consent, he or she should contact us at <a href="mailto:copperium.studios@gmail.com">copperium.studios@gmail.com</a>. We will delete such information from our files within a reasonable time.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Security</h2>
  
  <p>
    We are concerned about safeguarding the security of your information. We do not store your information ourselves; all of your data is stored on the Google cloud and is managed by Google security professionals. However, no security or encryption method can be guaranteed to protect information from hackers or human error.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Your Consent</h2>
  
  <p>
    In jurisdictions where explicit consent is not required, by using the Application, you consent to our processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by us. All activities will take place in Canada or the United States.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In jurisdictions where explicit consent is required, your information is collected and processed only after explicit consent is given. Your data is stored to the degree of security required by those jurisdictions.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Changes</h2>
  
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. We will notify you of any changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy here. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for updates, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.
